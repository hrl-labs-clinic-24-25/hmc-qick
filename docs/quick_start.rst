Quick-start guide
=================

**Have questions? Contact us through any of the channels listed on** :doc:`our support page </contact>`.

This guide will show you how to set up QICK after configuring your
computer and RFSoC board on a local area network (LAN). By the end of
this guide you will have run a QICK program in loopback mode (where
signals loop back from an RF-DAC directly into an RF-ADC)!

Up to the QICK-specific steps, the setup instructions below run parallel
to the PYNQ and RFSoC documentation, and you might want to refer to that
as well:

Get a board
-----------
The ZCU216, RFSoC4x2, and ZCU111 are all supported by QICK and have
identical FPGA logic capabilities; the differences are in the RF
DACs+ADCs and the design of the rest of the board. For new purchases we
generally recommend the current generation of RFSoC boards for the best
high-frequency performance: the ZCU216 or RFSoC4x2. The ZCU216 has a
higher channel count, allows for flexibility in AC- or DC-coupling your
signals, and can be used with custom frontend boards; the RFSoC4x2 is
available with academic pricing. But we highly recommend that you look
at the board specifications yourself.

The Xilinx-produced ZCU216 and ZCU111 boards are available from most
major electronics distributors - check the “Authorized Distributors”
list on the board’s Xilinx page:

* https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/zcu111.html
* https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/zcu216.html

The RealDigital-produced RFSoC4x2 board is available directly from
RealDigital: https://www.realdigital.org/hardware/rfsoc-4x2. We
recommend that when communicating with RealDigital or AMD/Xilinx, that
you mention that you plan to use the board with QICK - this helps them
understand your needs.

Prerequisites
-------------

-  Your RFSoC evaluation board kit, from which you will need the
   following:

   -  The RFSoC board itself, and any daughterboards:

      -  For the ZCU216, you’ll need the CLK-104 clocking board and the
         XM655 frontend board.
      -  For the ZCU111, you’ll need the XM500 frontend board.

   -  RF cables:

      -  An SMA cable that you will use to connect the system in
         loopback mode.
      -  For the ZCU216, you’ll also need the two HC2-to-SMA patch
         cables to connect the RF-DAC and RF-ADCs to baluns.

   -  Power brick
   -  The micro-SD card (16 GB or larger) that you will flash the PYNQ
      OS image onto; an adapter for full-size SD is also included
   -  Tools:

      -  A 5/16” wrench for SMA connectors (a torque wrench is nice if
         you have one, but the wrench in the kit is fine for these first
         tests).
      -  For ZCU216/ZCU111, a Phillips-head screwdriver (size #1) and 4
         mm hex wrench to attach the daughterboard(s).
      -  For ZCU216, an 0.050” hex wrench for the HC2 connectors.

   -  Ethernet cable
   -  Micro-USB cable (for debugging, or changing the network
      configuration)

-  A personal computer, which should have:

   -  An Ethernet port that you can free up temporarily

      -  If you don’t have a free port, you can buy a USB-Ethernet
         adapter - any reputable brand (TP-Link, StarTech) should be OK.

   -  An SD or micro-SD card reader (such as IOGEAR SuperSpeed USB 3.0
      SD/Micro SD Card Reader/Writer (GFR304SD) which is available for
      purchase at www.amazon.com). A reader that directly reads micro-SD
      cards is recommended, to avoid confusion with adapters.
   -  This guide assumes a Windows PC with the following tools so as to
      be accessible to users with little command-line programming
      experience, but you can use whatever tools you’re comfortable
      with. Linux and MacOS are also fine: you will be able to use their
      native SSH/SCP clients, but you will need to find your own
      utilities for writing SD card images.

      -  The computer should have git installed. In this guide, Github
         Desktop is used.

         -  You can download Github Desktop here:
            https://desktop.github.com/

      -  The computer should have either SSH or PuTTY/PSCP installed.
         PuTTY is an open-source SSH client for the Windows operating
         system. This guide uses PuTTY/PSCP for accessibility, as some
         users are not familiar with the command line.

         -  You can download PuTTY here:
            https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html
            (for instance ``putty-64bit-0.76-installer.msi``). This
            installer will also install the ``pscp`` command.

      -  The computer should have a utility for writing disk images to
         SD cards. We recommend the Win32DiskImager utility, which is an
         open-source tool for writing image files to disks. You will use
         this utility to flash the PYNQ OS image onto your micro-SD
         card.

         -  You can download the Win32DiskImager utility here:
            https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/ <!–

-  A router (this guide used a standard Cisco RV160 VPN Router which is
   available for purchase at www.amazon.com). The router used in this
   guide has 4 LAN ports. For instance, in a typical qubit control setup
   you can connect one LAN port to your personal computer, a second LAN
   port to your ZCU111, and a third point to an Ethernet switch (for
   example the NETGEAR 24-Port Gigabit Ethernet Unmanaged Switch
   (JGS524) which is available for purchase at www.amazon.com). That
   Ethernet switch can place 24 more devices (such as external trigger
   sources, local oscillators, programmable attenuators or other lab
   equipment) on the router’s subnet, making them accessible to your
   personal computer.
-  Two Ethernet cables that you will use to attach 1) your ZCU111 board
   and 2) your personal computer to the router. –>

Flash the PYNQ operating system image onto your micro SD card
-------------------------------------------------------------

-  Your RFSoC board kit comes with a micro SD card. QICK requires an
   up-to-date PYNQ image (v2.6 through v3.0.1), so let’s update the
   micro SD card with this version of the PYNQ image. The PYNQ
   documentation for this step is also good:
   https://pynq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/appendix/sdcard.html
-  First, download the PYNQ image:

   -  For ZCU111 and RFSoC4x2, v3.0.1 is the current recommended
      version: http://www.pynq.io/boards.html
   -  For ZCU216, download the v2.7.0 version from the link in
      https://github.com/sarafs1926/ZCU216-PYNQ/issues/1.

-  If you downloaded it as a .zip, you need to unzip it to get a .img
   file. You will see that it’s quite a large file.

.. image:: images/quick_start/largeimagefile.PNG
   :alt: The PYNQ 2.6.0 image file

-  Plug your micro SD card into your computer. If you look in the
   Windows File Explorer you will see a new disk drive pop up, for
   example in my case it was the ``E:\`` drive. This is the drive
   associated with your micro SD card.
-  Now, open the Win32DiskImager utility and configure 1) the image file
   to be your PYNQ image file and 2) the device to be the ``E:\`` drive,
   as in the below picture. Before clicking ``Write``, double check that
   you are not flashing the image file to the wrong drive (e.g. your
   personal computer hard drive)!

.. image:: images/quick_start/writetoEdrive.PNG
   :alt: Writing the PYNQ 2.6.0 image onto the micro SD card

-  Click ``Write``.
-  After the write completes, now look in the Windows File Explorer to
   see what is now contained in the ``E:\`` drive. You can see several
   files that are used to boot the RFSoC. The contents of the ``E:\``
   drive are lightweight and there is plenty more space on the disk
   (about 6.8 GB!). So we are now ready to load this micro SD card into
   the RFSoC board.

.. image:: images/quick_start/Eafterwrite.PNG
   :alt: The micro SD card drive after a successful write

Assemble and power on your RFSoC board
--------------------------------------

-  For the ZCU216 and ZCU111, assemble the board with daughterboard(s).
   The 4 mm hex wrench is used to tighten the jackscrew nuts under the
   frontend board screws, then the screwdriver is used to screw down the
   board. For both the frontend board and the ZCU216’s CLK-104 board, be
   careful to align the high-density connector before screwing down the
   board. You may find these resources useful in addition to the kit
   documentation:

   -  For the ZCU216 board, the basic assembly section of this webpage:
      https://xilinx-wiki.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/A/pages/246153525/RF+DC+Evaluation+Tool+for+ZCU216+board+-+Quick+start.
   -  For the ZCU111 board, this video guide:
      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JfKlv8kWhs

-  Slide your micro SD card into its slot on the board.
-  Make sure the board is in SD card boot mode.

   -  For the RFSoC4x2, this is a simple slider switch with “SD” and
      “JTAG” labels.
   -  For the ZCU216 and ZCU111, there’s a 4-position DIP switch (SW2 on
      the ZCU216, SW6 on the ZCU111) which you must set as shown in the
      photo below (of a ZCU111, but the switch is the same on the
      ZCU216), with the first position set to “ON” and the rest to
      “OFF.” Xilinx documentation:
      `ZCU216 <https://docs.amd.com/r/en-US/ug1390-zcu216-eval-bd/Zynq-UltraScale-RFSoC-XCZU49DR-Configuration>`__,
      `ZCU111 <https://docs.amd.com/r/en-US/ug1271-zcu111-eval-bd/RFSoC-Device-Configuration>`__.

.. image:: images/quick_start/Bootmodeswitch.png
  :alt: Boot mode switch

-  Use your wrench to wire an SMA cable between an RF-DAC channel and an
   RF-ADC channel.

   -  For the ZCU216, choose DAC 2_231 and ADC 0_226, which will be
      generator 6 and readout 0. This is a two-step process, because the
      XM655 directly exposes the differential ports of the RF-DACs and
      RF-ADCs, and you must patch these through to the baluns that
      convert them to regular (single-ended) signals:

      -  First identify the gold HC2 connector you want; e.g. 2_231 is
         labeled next to connector JHC3. Connect an HC2-SMA cable and
         screw it down.
      -  Now identify the P/N pair of SMA pigtails you want; e.g. the
         pair for 2_231 are the last two on this cable. Connect these to
         the P and N ports of an available low-frequency (10 MHz-1 GHz)
         balun. The third SMA connector next to this balun is the
         single-ended port; your SMA cable will connect the single-ended
         ports of the two baluns.
      -  See also
         https://docs.amd.com/r/en-US/ug1390-zcu216-eval-bd/CoreHC2-Connector-Pinout-XM655-Only

   -  For the RFSoC4x2, choose DAC_B and ADC_D, which will be generator
      0 and readout 0. (You will need to change the generator number in
      the demo notebook later, since the demos assume generator 6.)
   -  For the ZCU111, choose DAC 229 CH3 and ADC 224 CH0, which will be
      generator 6 and readout 0. These names are written directly on the
      XM500 breakout board. See also
      https://docs.amd.com/r/en-US/ug1271-zcu111-eval-bd/XM500-ADC/DAC-Data-and-Clock-SMA
   -  You’re doing this with the board powered down, but in general:
      it’s OK to connect/disconnect RF cables with the board powered.
      However, you should be very careful not to touch any of the
      exposed electrical components with metal tools or connectors.
      **This can cause immediate, permanent damage to your board which
      cannot be repaired.** In particular:
   -  The frontend daughterboards of the ZCU216 and ZCU111 have rows of
      header pins, some of which can destroy the board if shorted to
      each other or to ground.
   -  If you have SMA cables with loose ends (for example, the unused
      lines of a ZCU216’s HC2-to-SMA cable), always cover their
      connectors completely with the rubber caps that came with the
      cables.
   -  Observe general housekeeping and workplace hygiene principles -
      don’t leave loose tools rolling around your lab bench, keep loose
      adapters in bowls or drawers, be aware of where a tool might fall
      if dropped.

-  Connect an Ethernet cable and/or USB cable, and configure your
   computer, as specified in the next section.
-  Connect the power cable to the RFSoC board. Flip the board power
   switch on (it’s next to the power cable). You should hear the fan
   above the RFSoC chip begin to whir, and you should see LED lights
   blinking all over the board. You should also see lit or blinking LEDs
   that indicate the Ethernet port is connected to your computer: two
   LEDs built into the face of the port and a third LED next to the port
   labeled “LINK.”
-  Your board setup should look something like the below cartoon:

.. image:: images/quick_start/boardpic_cartoon.PNG
  :alt: An assembled ZCU111 board

-  The board will take a minute or two to boot up. Five minutes is more
   than enough; if you can’t connect to the RFSoC after this time
   something is wrong with your setup (check your cabling, check that
   your SD card is properly inserted, retry with a serial connection
   over USB as described below).

Connect to your RFSoC over the network
--------------------------------------

You will normally connect to the RFSoC over a network connection, most
typical setups are one of the following:

* Point-to-point: the RFSoC is directly connected to the PC through a single Ethernet cable.
  This is the simplest but usually not a long-term solution, because it consumes an Ethernet port on the PC.
  (The RFSoC4x2 also supports creating a point-to-point network connection over USB; refer to the 4x2 documentation.)
* LAN with static IPs: the RFSoC, PC, and other lab equipment are connected to a switch, which doesn’t assign IP addresses.
  Each piece of equipment has a unique static IP configured internally; all IPs are in a common range.
* LAN with router: the RFSoC, PC, and other lab equipment are connected to a router, which assigns IP addresses automatically.
  Other lab equipment might be connected to the router as well.
  The router could additionally be configured as an Internet gateway, to allow the PC and RFSoC to access the Internet.

  * Your institution’s network is probably capable of playing this role, but this is not recommended because problems are difficult to debug, and because this exposes the RFSoC to all other users on the network.
    Only do this if you have experience with Linux network configuration and security, know the network security rules for your institution, and follow all of the security recommendations below.

Configure the network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default network settings of the RFSoC are as follows (see the
section below for instructions on changing them):

* If it’s connected to a router, it will use an assigned address.
* Otherwise it will use 192.168.2.99.

It is sometimes difficult to tell what IP address the RFSoC is using.
Here are some ways:

* If you’re using a router, the router will know what address it assigned to the RFSoC (see the section below).
* You can use the serial-over-USB connection to log in and check the network status (see the section below)
* The RFSoC4x2 has an OLED screen that displays the IP address.

For a LAN with static IP
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The default settings are fine for point-to-point or router setups, but
for a static-IP LAN you will generally want an IP other than
192.168.2.99, because your other equipment is unlikely to be using the
192.168.2.xxx IP range. In that case you should make an initial
connection to change the RFSoC’s network settings, using one of the
other options (point-to-point network, router network, or
serial-over-USB). We recommend the point-to-point network, which is
usually the easiest to set up.

-  Once you have a terminal with root privileges, open
   ``/etc/network/interfaces.d/eth0`` in a text editor such as ``vim``
   or ``nano``.
-  If you’re not familiar with any command-line text editor, ``nano`` is
   a good choice:
-  Run ``nano /etc/network/interfaces.d/eth0`` to open the file.
-  Make your change. You can cut entire lines with Control+k and paste
   them with Control+u. A hash at the start of a line in an
   ``interfaces`` file comments it, which you might use to stash old
   settings or describe your changes.
-  Save with Control+o (hit Enter to write to the same file you opened)
-  Exit with Control+x.
-  The file will look like this:

::

   auto eth0
   iface eth0 inet dhcp

   auto eth0:1
   iface eth0:1 inet static
   address 192.168.2.99
   netmask 255.255.255.0

-  Change the ``192.168.2.99`` to the desired static IP address, and
   save the file. You can now close the terminal, power off the RFSoC
   board, and connect it to the switch.
-  Configure youe computer’s Ethernet port to connect to the LAN with a
   static IP.

For a point-to-point Ethernet connection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Connect your Ethernet cable from your computer to the RFSoC Ethernet
   port.
-  Configure your computer’s Ethernet port with a static IP in the
   192.168.2.xxx range, similar to below (see also
   https://pynq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/appendix/assign_a_static_ip.html):

.. image:: images/quick_start/static_ip.png
  :alt: Setting a static IP in Windows

-  After powering up, the board should be online at ``192.168.2.99``.
   You can now connect to it at this address using Jupyter or SSH (see
   below).

For a LAN with a router
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use a router (e.g. a Cisco RV160 VPN Router which is available for
purchase at www.amazon.com), which will automatically assign an IP
address to your RFSoC board. The router used in this guide has 4 LAN
ports. For instance, in a typical qubit control setup you can connect
one LAN port to your personal computer, a second LAN port to your
ZCU216, and a third point to an Ethernet switch (for example the NETGEAR
24-Port Gigabit Ethernet Unmanaged Switch (JGS524) which is available
for purchase at www.amazon.com). That Ethernet switch can place 24 more
devices (such as external trigger sources, local oscillators,
programmable attenuators or other lab equipment) on the router’s subnet,
making them accessible to your personal computer.

-  Connect both your computer and the RFSoC to the router with Ethernet
   cables.
-  Unlike the point-to-point case, you won’t set a static IP on your
   computer’s Ethernet port; you’ll leave it on its default
   configuration, where it will let the router auto-configure its
   address.
-  Log into your router via a web browser. In the case of the router
   used in this guide, doing so is straightforward and is explained
   here:
   https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/routers/csbr/RV160/Quick_Start_Guide/EN/RV160_qsg_en.pdf
-  After powering up, look at the list of devices found by your router.
   You should see two devices; your PC and your RFSoC (id ``pynq``).
   Take note of the IP address that was assigned to the RFSoC (in my
   case it was assigned the address ``192.168.1.146``). You can now
   connect to the board at this address using Jupyter or SSH (see
   below).

.. image:: images/quick_start/ciscorouter.PNG
  :alt: Devices found by the router

-  Most routers will allow you to assign a permanent IP address to the
   RFSoC based on its MAC address, which you can get by running the
   ``ifconfig`` command in a terminal and looking for ``ether``. The
   ZCU216 and ZCU111 have a sticker with the MAC address, and you should
   check that this matches the output of ``ifconfig`` (if not, see
   https://github.com/openquantumhardware/qick/issues/182).

Log in
~~~~~~

You can connect to the RFSoC over the network in two ways: through the
RFSoC’s Jupyter server, which you access using a web browser and Jupyter
password, and through the RFSoC’s SSH server, which you access using SSH
and SCP clients and Linux password. Jupyter will probably be your main
interface, and you will use it to run the QICK demos. SSH gives you a
terminal and SCP is used for file transfers; you can also create
terminals and upload/download files in Jupyter, but it’s not as
flexible. You will use SCP to upload the QICK software and firmware to
the RFSoC.

The Jupyter server and the Linux operating system have separate access
credentials, with the following defaults:

* Jupyter: password is ``xilinx``.
* Linux OS: username is ``xilinx``, password is ``xilinx``.
  There is also a root (admin) account, password ``xilinx``, but the ``xilinx`` user can become root using ``sudo -s`` (you will need to enter the user password).

**These defaults are very insecure.** You must change them if your RFSoC
will be connected to a network accessible to people outside your lab
group. Some of the default settings have alternatives that add no
inconvenience, and we recommend that everyone should change those even
if the network is safe. See the section below on “Secure your RFSoC” for
details.

Over the network, via Jupyter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Now you are prepared to connect to your RFSoC. Before you clone the
   ``qick`` repository and copy it onto the RFSoC, let’s see what is
   initially on the RFSoC’s operating system (this was determined by the
   contents of the PYNQ image). To do so, simply enter the IP address
   assigned to the RFSoC into a web browser on your personal computer:
   ``192.168.1.146``. The username and password for the ZCU111 are by
   default ``xilinx`` and ``xilinx``, respectively. You can change those
   by entering ``sudo`` mode once you’ve logged into the RFSoC via SSH
   (you will log in via SSH in the next part of this guide).
-  You should see this default Jupyter notebook browser:

.. image:: images/quick_start/pynqstartup.PNG
  :alt: PYNQ startup

-  You can see that there are a few demo Jupyter notebooks already
   loaded onto the RFSoC which you can feel free to explore. But now
   let’s connect to the RFSoC via SSH, where you will have more
   flexibility and control. For instance, only after you have
   established an SSH connection can you copy the ``qick`` repo onto the
   RFSoC and do the upcoming QICK loopback demo.
-  If you need to open a root terminal for changing network settings,
   click the “New” button at the upper right and open a terminal.

Over the network, via SSH
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  To connect via SSH, open the PuTTY application and input the IP
   address assigned to the RFSoC (``192.168.1.146``) as below:

.. image:: images/quick_start/putty1.PNG
  :alt: Using PuTTY (1)

-  Click ``Open``. You will see the following login screen on a new
   terminal. Use the Linux username and password (by default, ``xilinx``
   and ``xilinx``).

.. image:: images/quick_start/putty2.PNG
  :alt: Using PuTTY (2)

-  After successfully logging in you will see a Linux terminal. You have
   now remotely logged on to the RFSoC.

.. image:: images/quick_start/putty3.PNG
  :alt: Using PuTTY (3)

-  If you need root privileges for changing settings, run ``sudo -s``
   and enter the user password again.
-  It’s convenient to save these session settings; you can also set the
   username as part of the hostname e.g. ``xilinx@192.168.1.146``.

Through a serial connection over USB, for debugging or changing the configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can also log in to the RFSoC using a serial connection.

* Connect a PC to the board via the micro-USB port.
  Under the Device Manager under COM ports the RFSoC should show up as three COM connections.
  Usually, the port you should use is the first of those three.
* Power up the RFSoC board.
  It is important to boot the board after the USB cable has been connected between the board and your PC.
* Using PuTTY, select “Serial” connection type, enter the port number (e.g. ``COM4``), and the serial speed, ``115200``.
* This will open a terminal that directly connects to the RFSoC CPU.
  You may need to log in with Linux credentials.

These are things you might check:

* For debugging network issues, ``ifconfig`` will give the assigned IP address.
* If the RFSoC is having trouble accessing network devices outside the LAN, the default gateway may not be set; this can be checked with ``ip route``.
  There should be an IP address marked as ``default``.
  If this is not present, a default must be set using ``sudo ip route add default via xxx.xxx.xxx.1``, replacing the IP address with the local network address.
* Finally, the RFSoC may need to be configured to properly access the internet.
  Open ``/etc/resolv.conf`` in a text editor such as ``vim`` or ``nano``, and ensure that it contains ``nameserver 8.8.8.8``, ``options eth0``.
  Note that ``resolv.conf`` may be re-generated when the board is power-cycled.

Secure your RFSoC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As mentioned above, the default settings for accessing the RFSoC are
quite insecure. If you change nothing, anybody with access to the
RFSoC’s network will be able to get full access without much difficulty.
The significance of this depends on your network configuration and the
harm that could be caused by a breach. In other words:

* How much do you trust the people and devices on the RFSoC’s network?
  If you have a point-to-point connection, the RFSoC is only connected to your PC, so the network is as secure as your PC.
  If you put the RFSoC on your institution’s network, you can trust the network only as much as you trust every user and device on the network - if an attacker compromises any computer at your institution, they could then attack your RFSoC.
* What harm could an attacker do?
  If the security of your RFSoC is compromised, they could read, delete, or modify anything on the SD card, run arbitrary malware on the RFSoC, or control any equipment controlled by the RFSoC.
  So you should judge the consequences of this.
* Are there any rules you need to follow?
  Your institution may have rules about securing computers that are connected to the institution’s network, connected to expensive equipment, or used for important/sensitive research.
  These rules may apply, and may be stricter than what you would arrive at by taking a “common sense” approach to the two points above.

You should weigh these factors and the recommendations below.

Disable root login
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Brute-force password-guessing attacks against SSH servers are extremely
common, and the root account is a common target because the username is
standard and the account has maximum privileges. The default root
password of ``xilinx`` is easily guessed. You could set a stronger root
password, or block SSH login for the root account, but given that
``sudo`` is just as easy a way to get root privileges, you never
actually need to use the root password and it’s easier to disable it
completely. In other words, this improves security and adds no
inconvenience; **everyone should make this change.**

-  Log in via SSH using the ``xilinx`` username and that account’s
   password (``xilinx``, unless you’ve changed it).
-  Run ``su`` and enter the root password (``xilinx``) to become root.
-  Run ``passwd -l root`` to lock the root password. This makes it
   impossible to log in as root over SSH or using ``su``, but you can
   still get root access through Jupyter or ``sudo``.
-  Run ``exit`` (or use the keyboard shortcut Control-d) to exit your
   root session and get back to being a regular user.
-  Run ``su`` and enter the ``xilinx`` password again. This should fail!
-  Run ``sudo -s`` and enter the user password to check that you can
   still use ``sudo`` to become root.

The terminal output from these steps should look like this:

::

   xilinx@pynq:~$ su
   Password: 
   root@pynq:/home/xilinx# passwd -l root
   passwd: password expiry information changed.
   root@pynq:/home/xilinx# exit
   exit
   xilinx@pynq:~$ su
   Password: 
   su: Authentication failure
   xilinx@pynq:~$ sudo -s
   [sudo] password for xilinx: 
   root@pynq:/home/xilinx#

Change the Linux user password
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The default username and password are both ``xilinx``, and this is
easily guessed if an attacker knows the board is running PYNQ OS.
Because this account has ``sudo`` rights, knowing this account’s
password is as good as having root access. Changing the password doesn’t
add significant inconvenience. **We strongly recommend that you change
this password.**

Choose the strength and style (random characters, random words, etc.) of
the password based on what is natural to you and your lab group, how
secure you need your RFSoC to be, and how dangerous the network
environment is.
A password manager or password generator can help with generating a high-quality password.
You should store the password in a secure and resilient
way; again this will depend on how your lab group operates, but could
mean a lab notebook, a file on a secure shared disk, or a password manager.

-  Choose a new password and make a record of it.
-  Log in via SSH using the ``xilinx`` username and that account’s
   password (``xilinx``).
-  Run ``passwd``; enter the current password (``xilinx`` again) and
   then enter your desired password twice.
-  Disconnect and check that you can log in via SSH using the new
   password.

The terminal output from these steps should look like this:

::

   xilinx@pynq:~$ passwd
   Changing password for xilinx.
   Current password: 
   New password: 
   Retype new password: 
   passwd: password updated successfully
   xilinx@pynq:~$ 

Restrict remote Jupyter access
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Because the Jupyter server runs with root privileges, having access to
Jupyter is as good as having root access. The default password
``xilinx`` is easily guessed; also, because the Jupyter server uses HTTP
and not HTTPS, an attacker listening to traffic on your network could
get a hash of your password when you log in (not as bad as getting the
password, but this is still considered a risk). The preferred solution
is to block remote access to Jupyter, and only access Jupyter through
SSH. This adds a step when connecting to Jupyter, but is easy to set up
(easier than changing the Jupyter password, and more effective for
security). **We strongly recommend this if your RFSoC is on an untrusted
network.**

To set this up, get a terminal with root privileges and open
``/root/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py`` in a text editor (such as
``nano`` - see the section above on setting up a static IP). Page down
to the bottom, where you should see something like this:

::

   # c.TerminalManager.cull_interval = 300
   c.NotebookApp.ip = '0.0.0.0'
   c.NotebookApp.notebook_dir = '/home/xilinx/jupyter_notebooks'
   c.NotebookApp.password = 'sha1:46c5ef4fa52f:ee46dad5008c6270a52f6272828a51b16336b492'

Put a hash at the beginning of the line with ``c.NotebookApp.ip``, to
comment out that setting. Now reboot. Point your browser to the RFSoC’s
IP address (for example 192.168.1.146): it should redirect to port 9090
(i.e. the address bar should show ``192.168.1.146:9090``) as usual, but
the page should not load.

To access Jupyter after making this change, you will need to use SSH
port forwarding:

* Add port forwarding to your SSH configuration.
  The example below shows how you would tell PuTTY to forward port 5678 on your PC to port 9090 on the RFSoC (the Jupyter server’s port).
  The choice of 5678 is arbitrary, and if you connect to multiple RFSoCs from the same computer in this way you need to use different ports.
  (If using macOS or Linux, you would specify port forwarding as part of the command, e.g. ``ssh xilinx@192.168.1.146 -L 5678:localhost:9090``.)

.. image:: images/quick_start/port_forward.png
  :alt: PuTTY configuration for port forwarding

-  Make the SSH connection. You will need to leave the connection open
   while using the Jupyter server.
-  Point your browser to ``localhost:5678``. You should get the Jupyter
   server.
-  You might need to open port 5678 in your firewall: one way to do this
   is to enable the checkbox “Local ports accept connections from other
   hosts” in the PuTTY configuration shown above and make the
   connection, which should trigger Windows to ask if you want to open
   the port. Once you’ve done this, you should disable that checkbox
   (since you’re otherwise exposing the Jupyter server to the network
   again, just through your PC instead of directly from the RFSoC).

Copy the QICK tools onto your RFSoC
-----------------------------------

-  Use Github Desktop to clone the ``qick`` repo onto your personal
   computer (Google around for resources if you are not sure how to do
   this).
-  Open the Command Prompt application in Windows and, after navigating
   to the directory containing your cloned ``qick`` repo, type in the
   following command (substituting the IP address that was assigned to
   your RFSoC):

.. image:: images/quick_start/pushingdatatotheboard.PNG
  :alt: Pushing data to the RFSoC with pscp

-  This copied the ``qick`` repository into the ``jupyter_notebooks``
   folder in the ``/home/xilinx/`` directory of the RFSoC.
-  Your Jupyter notebook browser has now updated to include the ``qick``
   repository, as shown below:

.. image:: images/quick_start/jupyternotebook1.PNG
  :alt: Jupyter notebook main folder

Install the ``qick`` Python package and running a QICK program in loopback mode
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

..   * Navigate to the `qick` directory and run: `sudo python3 -m pip install .`
   This will install the qick Python package.

-  Navigate to the ``qick_demos`` subfolder within the ``qick``
   directory and run the Jupyter notebook
   ``000_Install_qick_package.ipynb``. This will walk you through
   installing and testing the ``qick`` package.
-  Open ``00_Send_receive_pulse.ipynb`` (also in the ``qick_demos``
   directory) and run the Jupyter notebook cells in order. You should
   see very similar output to that posted here:
   https://github.com/openquantumhardware/qick/blob/main/qick_demos/00_Send_receive_pulse.ipynb.
   You are seeing pulses being sent out of the RFSoC RF-DACs and looping
   back to the RFSoC RF-ADCs! In future tutorials you will learn the
   meaning of all the variables and parameters defined within the
   Jupyter notebook cells.

..   ## Running a QICK program in loopback mode

   * You can also take the opportunity to check that you have flashed the correct PYNQ version:

    <img src="quick-start-guide-pics/correctpynqversion.PNG" alt="The correct PYNQ version">
   </p>

Copy data off of your RFSoC and onto your personal computer
-----------------------------------------------------------

-  Let’s say that you have created a ``quick_start_demo`` directory with
   your work and you want a local copy of the entire directory (for
   example, you exported your data to ``.png`` plots that are within the
   ``quick_start_demo`` directory on the RFSoC, and you want to move
   those plots back to your personal computer). To do this, you do
   something analogous to when you copied the ``qick`` repository onto
   the RFSoC earlier in this guide:
-  Open the Command Prompt application in Windows and, after navigating
   to your local directory where you want the files to go, type in the
   following command (substituting the IP address that was assigned to
   your RFSoC):

.. image:: images/quick_start/pullingdataofftheboard.PNG
  :alt: Pulling data off the RFSoC with pscp

-  Now the ``quick_start_demo`` directory has been copied to your local
   directory.

Next steps
----------

-  You should work through the demo notebooks in ``qick_demos`` to learn how QICK works and see some example programs for making measurements with QICK.
-  It's recommended, but not essential, to set up Pyro4 to allow the firmware state to persist between notebooks or scripts.
   The demo notebooks (and QICK in general) can be used with or without Pyro4.
   See the `Pyro4 demo notebooks <https://github.com/openquantumhardware/qick/blob/main/pyro4/00_nameserver.ipynb>`_ for more information.

**Hopefully this guide was a helpful introduction to QICK!**
